	"maintext" : "<p>Nolan brought joy and smiles to his parents, family, friends, and many others. A family friend thought of Nolan as 'sunshine'. He exhibited a great sense of humor and quick wit. Sensitive and loving, he was intensely loyal to his family and friends. Nolan did not want to be defined or limited by his epilepsy and chose to be very active socially and to live his life to the fullest. Nolan lived and breathed his passion for computers and all things technical. What began in Queen of Peace School carried on through Edgewood High School to Madison College and beyond. This passion and his skills and expertise led Nolan to working in the internet security field and then to his move to San Antonio to be a systems engineer. Nolan greatly enjoyed work and its technical challenges. He also took pleasure in planning and presenting at meetings, such as programs during DEF CON - the world's longest-running and largest hacking conference held annually in Las Vegas for hackers, IT professionals and three-letter government agencies - as well as at other cybersecurity seminars and workshops.</p>",
